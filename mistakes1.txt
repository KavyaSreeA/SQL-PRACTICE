## 📘 Part 1 — Mistake Analysis Summary

SQL Learning Progress — Mistake Analysis (INSERT • NULL • UPDATE)

This document records my mistake patterns, corrections, and lessons learned while practicing SQL data modification statements. The goal is to build clean query habits and avoid real-world data loss issues.

Topics Covered

* INSERT INTO
* NULL handling
* IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
* UPDATE (single + multiple rows)
* UPDATE with conditions
* Multi-row INSERT
* Auto-increment awareness

---

1. INSERT Statement — Mistake Patterns & Fixes

Mistake: Missing `INTO` and table name
Wrong:
INSERT CustomerName, City, Country VALUES(...)

Correct:
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES (...)

Lesson: Always include

* INTO
* table name
* column list inside parentheses

---

Mistake: Inserting values without specifying columns
Wrong:
INSERT INTO Customers VALUES (...)

Risk:

* breaks if table structure changes
* fails if auto-increment exists

Correct (safe):

INSERT INTO Customers
(CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES (...)

Lesson: ALWAYS specify column names in INSERT.

---

Mistake: Mixing SELECT + INSERT
Wrong:
SELECT CustomerName, Country VALUES(...)

Correct:
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, Country)
VALUES (...)

Lesson:
INSERT adds rows — SELECT retrieves rows.

---

Mistake: Multi-row insert without column names

Correct:

INSERT INTO Customers
(CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES (...), (...)

Lesson: All rows share same column order.

---

Auto-Increment Understanding

CustomerID was NOT manually inserted — correct behavior.
Rule: Do NOT insert values into auto-increment keys.

---

2. NULL & IS NULL — Mistake Patterns & Fixes

Core Rule
NULL cannot be compared using = or <>

Wrong:
WHERE Address = NULL

Correct:
WHERE Address IS NULL

Wrong:
WHERE ContactName <> NULL

Correct:
WHERE ContactName IS NOT NULL

---

Mistake: Missing FROM clause
Wrong:
SELECT Customers WHERE Address IS NULL

Correct:
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Address IS NULL

Lesson:
SELECT requires:

SELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition

---

NULL Concept Lessons

* NULL means “no value stored”
* NOT the same as

  * zero
  * empty string
  * blank spaces

---

3. UPDATE Statement — Mistake Patterns & Fixes

Mistake: Semicolon before WHERE (dangerous)

Wrong:

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Emma';
WHERE CustomerID = 3;

Effect: First statement updated ALL rows

Correct:

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Emma'
WHERE CustomerID = 3;

Lesson: Never end UPDATE before WHERE.

---

Mistake: Updating without table name

Wrong:
UPDATE CustomerName SET ...

Correct:
UPDATE Customers
SET CustomerName = ...

---

Mistake: Updating ALL rows accidentally

UPDATE Customers
SET City = 'Rome';

Effect: every record becomes Rome

Lesson: Always confirm WHERE before UPDATE.

---

Safe Workflow Habit

1. Run SELECT with same WHERE
2. Verify affected rows
3. Then run UPDATE

---

Mistake: Wrong field meaning change

Changing Country → City value is logically invalid.

Lesson: SQL will not protect meaning — developer must.

---

UPDATE Multiple Columns — Correct Pattern

UPDATE Customers
SET City = 'Madrid',
  ContactName = 'Carlos Ruiz'
WHERE Country = 'Spain'
AND CustomerID > 10;

---

UPDATE with NULL condition

UPDATE Customers
SET PostalCode = '00000'
WHERE PostalCode IS NULL;

---

Key Takeaways

✔ Always specify columns in INSERT
✔ Use IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
✔ UPDATE requires table name
✔ Double-check WHERE before updating
✔ Avoid accidental full-table updates
✔ Think about real-world data meaning
