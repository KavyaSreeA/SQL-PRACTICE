SELECT City , Country , CustomerName 
FROM Customers 
WHERE NAME = ALEX 
CITY = LONDON 
COUNTRY = UK;
❌ Problems
You used SELECT instead of INSERT

NAME column doesn’t exist

Missing INSERT INTO

Missing VALUES

Strings not in quotes

Missing commas / AND

You remembered what data, but not how to add data — totally normal.

✅ Correct INSERT
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES ('Alex', 'London', 'UK');


❌ Q4 — UPDATE syntax

Your answer:

UPDATE Salary 
SET Salary = 45000
WHERE CustomerID = 2;

❌ Issue

UPDATE must reference table, not column

✅ Correct
UPDATE Customers
SET Salary = 45000
WHERE CustomerID = 2;
