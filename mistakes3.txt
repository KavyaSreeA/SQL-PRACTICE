# SQL Learning Log 🚀

This repository tracks my **SQL learning journey**, focusing on real mistakes I made, why they happened, and how I fixed them.  
The goal is **conceptual clarity + precision**, not just memorizing syntax.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered

- SELECT, WHERE
- AND / OR / NOT
- INSERT, UPDATE
- NULL handling
- ORDER BY
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- Basic string functions (`LENGTH`)
- Tie-breaking logic with `ORDER BY`

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes I Made (and Fixes)

### 1️⃣ Column Name Confusion (Very Frequent)
**Mistake**
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Customers;


Problem

Column does not exist (Name ≠ CustomerName)

Fix

SELECT CustomerName FROM Customers;


Lesson

SQL does NOT guess column names. One wrong name = wrong query.

2️⃣ Forgetting Quotes for Text Values

Mistake

WHERE Country = India;


Fix

WHERE Country = 'India';


Lesson

Text values ALWAYS need single quotes.

3️⃣ UPDATE Syntax Errors

Mistake

UPDATE Salary SET Salary = 50000;


Fix

UPDATE Customers
SET Salary = 50000
WHERE CustomerID = 6;


Lesson

UPDATE always starts with the table name, not the column.

4️⃣ Incorrect NULL Checks

Mistake

WHERE Salary = NULL;


Fix

WHERE Salary IS NULL;


Lesson

NULL is not a value — it must be checked using IS NULL / IS NOT NULL.

5️⃣ AND / OR Logic Without Parentheses

Mistake

WHERE Country = 'India' OR Country = 'USA' AND Salary > 40000;


Fix

WHERE Country IN ('India','USA')
AND Salary > 40000;


Lesson

AND runs before OR.
Use parentheses or IN to control logic.

6️⃣ Misusing NOT

Mistake

WHERE <> (City = 'Delhi');


Fix

WHERE City <> 'Delhi';
-- or
WHERE NOT (City = 'Delhi');


Lesson

<> compares values.
NOT wraps a full condition.

7️⃣ INNER JOIN Syntax Errors (Logic Was Correct)

Mistake

INNER JOINS Order
ON c.CustomerID = o.Customer.ID


Fix

INNER JOIN Orders o
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;


Lesson

JOIN logic was right — mistakes were mechanical (names & spelling).

8️⃣ LEFT JOIN Misconception

Mistake

LEFT JOIN Orders o
...
WHERE o.Amount IS NOT NULL OR o.Amount IS NULL;


Fix

SELECT c.CustomerName, o.Amount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;


Lesson

LEFT JOIN already keeps NULL rows.
A WHERE condition on the right table can cancel LEFT JOIN.

9️⃣ JOIN Without ON Condition

Mistake

FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders;


Fix

INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;


Lesson

JOIN without ON = Cartesian product (wrong).

🔟 String Length & Ordering Logic

Mistake

Didn’t know how to resolve ties

Fix

ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;


Lesson

Tie-breaking requires secondary ORDER BY.
